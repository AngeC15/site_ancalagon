       <p> You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
       </p>
        <p> You hit me with a cricket bat. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
    </p>
        <p>  Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

        <p> I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
    </p>
        <p> You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

        No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
    </p>
        <p> I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You've swallowed a planet! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

        *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

        You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

        No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
